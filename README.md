"A Conceptual Introduction to Git" by Charles Duan - conversion to eBook Formats

## What?

It's [Understanding Git Conceptually](http://www.sbf5.com/~cduan/technical/git/) converted to a single article and various ebook formats.

Original article is (c) Charles Duen

## Why?

I found an interesting multi page article about Git. I wanted to read it on my e-reader. I fell in to a Markdown / PanDoc / Haskel kind of Yak Shaving hole.

So I used html2txt, some manual editing, haskell, pandoc, and calibre to turn it in to an ebook. 

Then @revdancatt showed me a website that did it automatically.

Never mind
